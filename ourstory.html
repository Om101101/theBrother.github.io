			Our story wrote its early chapters in 2018 in Lucknow where Mr. Om jaiswal nd Mr.Satish Sahu the idea of luxury hospitality in India by opening his first hotel. The lessons self-taught, the inevitable mistakes made, the wisdom gained, the prestigious awards won. All have formed the compass for successive generations of The Brother's.

To this day, we still practice the most simple and uncommon of operational philosophies that began with Mr.Om jaiswal Mr. Satish sahu himself : The guest is everything.
Our joy comes from ensuring each is seen and valued as a person, a friend, a family member who has come to stay. It ‘s present in every gesture through words spoken or unspoken, in ways that are obvious and in ways that are quietly respectful of one’s time and privacy.

You will be hard pressed to find properties as beautiful as ours or restaurants, guest rooms and facilities that are as exceptional. But these are not what give the brother Hotels & Resorts its incomparable reputation.
What our guests speak about most is that singular experience of being truly seen, heard and understood. Something no other hotel or resort can emulate. The astonishing effect one feels from an act, a gesture, a word; that is heart felt.
